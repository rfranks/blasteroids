## Reporting a Vulnerability

Here is where to go, what to expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, and what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

Please file an [issue](https://github.com/rfranks/blasteroids/issues) and label it `security`.
Watch this repo and the issue.
If it is accepted, it will be fixed. Otherwise, it will be declined with some reasoning.
